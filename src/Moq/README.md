This repository supports [corebuild](http://www.corebuild.io) for configure/build/test from `msbuild`.

> **IMPORTANT**: this repository is for the *upcoming* version of Moq. Issues and source for the current stable Moq v4.x are at https://github.com/moq/moq4

## Building the repository

```
msbuild /t:configure
msbuild
```

The default target is `Help`, which will render the documentation for the build itself and what targets are available. Since this is a [corebuild](http://www.corebuild.io) standard repository, you can run:

```
msbuild /t:configure
msbuild /t:build
msbuild /t:test
```

## Dependencies

The packaging projects are [NuGetizer](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Build.Packaging/) projects, and require the [VS2017 extension](http://bit.ly/nugetizer-2017) to load in Visual Studio. The extension is not necessary to build the packages from MSBuild, however.
